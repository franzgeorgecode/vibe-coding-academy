        content: `# The Art of Prompt Engineering

Writing effective prompts is like learning a new language - the language of AI collaboration. The better you communicate your ideas, the better bolt.new can bring them to life.

## The CLEAR Method

### C - Context
Always provide context about what you're building:
- "I'm building a task management app for small teams"
- "This is an e-commerce site for handmade crafts"

### L - List Requirements
Be specific about features and functionality:
- "Users should be able to create, edit, and delete tasks"
- "Include user authentication with email/password"
- "Add a shopping cart with payment processing"

### E - Examples
Provide examples when helpful:
- "Like Trello but simpler"
- "Similar to the login flow on GitHub"

### A - Aesthetics
Describe the visual style:
- "Modern, minimalist design with a dark theme"
- "Colorful and playful, suitable for children"

### R - Requirements
Technical specifications:
- "Use React and Node.js"
- "Store data in PostgreSQL"
- "Deploy to Vercel"

## Common Prompt Patterns

### The Progressive Prompt
Start simple, then add complexity:
1. "Create a basic todo app"
2. "Add user authentication"
3. "Include team collaboration features"

### The Specific Feature Prompt
Focus on one feature at a time:
"Add a search function that filters tasks by title and description, with real-time results as the user types"

### The Modification Prompt
Build on existing code:
"Change the color scheme to use blue as the primary color instead of green"

## Prompt Pitfalls to Avoid

❌ **Too Vague**: "Make a website"
✅ **Better**: "Create a portfolio website for a graphic designer with a gallery, about page, and contact form"

❌ **Too Complex**: "Build a full social media platform with messaging, posts, stories, live streaming, marketplace, and AI recommendations"
✅ **Better**: "Create a simple social media app where users can post text updates and follow each other"

Remember: You can always iterate and add features!`,

        objective: 'Master complex database queries and relationships',
        content: `# Advanced Database Operations

Now that you understand the basics, let's dive into more sophisticated database operations that will make your applications truly powerful.

## Database Relationships

### One-to-One
Each record in one table relates to exactly one record in another.
Example: User ↔ Profile

### One-to-Many
One record relates to multiple records in another table.
Example: User → Posts (one user can have many posts)

### Many-to-Many
Multiple records in one table relate to multiple records in another.
Example: Users ↔ Roles (users can have multiple roles, roles can have multiple users)

## Advanced Queries

### Joins
Combine data from multiple tables:
- **INNER JOIN**: Only matching records
- **LEFT JOIN**: All records from left table
- **RIGHT JOIN**: All records from right table
- **FULL JOIN**: All records from both tables

### Aggregations
Perform calculations on data:
- **COUNT**: Number of records
- **SUM**: Total of numeric values
- **AVG**: Average of numeric values
- **MAX/MIN**: Highest/lowest values

### Filtering and Sorting
- **WHERE**: Filter records based on conditions
- **ORDER BY**: Sort results
- **GROUP BY**: Group similar records
- **HAVING**: Filter grouped results

## Indexing for Performance

Indexes speed up data retrieval:
- Create indexes on frequently searched columns
- Avoid over-indexing (slows down writes)
- Use composite indexes for multi-column searches

## Database Security

### Authentication
Control who can access your database.

### Authorization
Control what authenticated users can do.

### Data Validation
Ensure data meets requirements before storage.

### Encryption
Protect sensitive data at rest and in transit.

## Prompting for Advanced Operations

Examples of advanced prompts:
- "Create a many-to-many relationship between users and projects"
- "Add an index on the email field for faster user lookups"
- "Implement soft delete for posts (mark as deleted instead of removing)"
- "Add full-text search capability to the articles table"

bolt.new understands these complex requirements and implements them properly!`,

        objective: 'Implement real-time features using Supabase in bolt.new',
        content: `# Real-time Data with Supabase

Real-time features make applications feel alive and responsive. With Supabase and bolt.new, you can add real-time capabilities with simple prompts.

## What is Real-time Data?

Real-time data updates your application instantly when changes occur in the database, without requiring page refreshes or manual updates.

### Common Use Cases
- **Chat Applications**: Messages appear instantly
- **Collaborative Tools**: See others' changes live
- **Live Dashboards**: Data updates automatically
- **Notifications**: Instant alerts for important events
- **Gaming**: Real-time score updates

## Supabase Real-time Features

### Database Changes
Listen to INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE operations on any table.

### Row Level Security
Real-time updates respect your security policies.

### Presence
Track who's online and what they're doing.

### Broadcast
Send custom messages between clients.

## Implementing Real-time Features

### Basic Real-time Subscription
"Add real-time updates to the chat messages - new messages should appear instantly for all users"

### Filtered Subscriptions
"Listen for real-time updates only on posts by the current user"

### Presence Tracking
"Show which users are currently online and viewing the document"

### Real-time Notifications
"Send real-time notifications when someone mentions a user in a comment"

## Best Practices

### 1. Optimize Subscriptions
Only subscribe to data you actually need to avoid unnecessary updates.

### 2. Handle Connection States
Gracefully handle when users go offline/online.

### 3. Debounce Updates
Prevent overwhelming the UI with too many rapid updates.

### 4. Security First
Ensure real-time subscriptions respect your security rules.

### 5. Cleanup Subscriptions
Always unsubscribe when components unmount to prevent memory leaks.

## Real-time Architecture

### Client-Side
Your application subscribes to changes and updates the UI.

### Server-Side
Supabase detects database changes and broadcasts them to subscribed clients.

### Network Layer
WebSocket connections maintain real-time communication.

## Performance Considerations

### Connection Limits
Be mindful of concurrent connection limits.

### Bandwidth Usage
Real-time updates consume bandwidth - optimize payload size.

### Battery Life
Constant connections can drain mobile device batteries.

## Prompting for Real-time Features

Examples:
- "Make the todo list update in real-time when anyone adds or completes a task"
- "Add live typing indicators to the chat"
- "Show real-time visitor count on the homepage"
- "Implement live collaborative editing for documents"

bolt.new will handle the complex WebSocket setup and subscription management for you!`,
